# WEB APP

## PREREQUISITE
1. NodeJS (>=v4.4.7) 
2. Docker Engine (>=1.9) and Docker Compose (>=1.8)

### Currently, we have 2 environments: DEVELOPMENT & DEPLOYMENT

## RUN THE DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT

0. Go to 2 folder: frontend and backend and follow the instruction in each folder to install the app first

1. In your terminal, run the proxy:
```
$ cd /path/to/Bitapp && ./develop.sh
```

2. Put in your /etc/hosts:
```
127.0.0.1 db
```

3. Open a new tab in your terminal to run the frontend:
```
$ cd /path/to/Bitapp/frontend
$ npm run dev
```

4. Open a new tab in your terminal to run the backend:
```
$ cd /path/to/Bitapp/backend
$ npm run compile && npm start
```

The application should be running on port 5555 of your localhost

# RUN THE DEPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENT

0. Please make sure that you dont have any process (eg: mongo server) running on port 27017
How to clean a running Mongo instance on local:
```
$ mongo # access the local mongo db fisrt
$ use admin # this is needed since we need the admin permission to shutdown mongo
$ db.shutdownServer() # your server should be shutting down now. just exit from mongo client and try to run the ./develop.sh script again
``` 

1. Create a local docker registry
```
$ docker run -d --name local_registry -p 5000:5000 registry:2
```

2. Run
```
$ ./deploy.sh
```

# ACCESSING POSTGRESQL INSIDE DOCKER
1. In production ENVIRONMENT
```
$ docker exec -it mvdevelopment_db_1 bash # this will bring you to the db's docker container
$ psql db_name username # then, inside the container you just need to do this to access the db
```
